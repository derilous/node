How v numbers are done

eg lodash: "^4.17.11" -> //major.minor.patch
                      -> // ^ denotes  the rules that I do not update major updates automatically. 
                      -> // ~ denotes that I only download patch updates when I npm and nothing else
                      -> // no sign denotes that no updates will be downloaded for this package when i npm
